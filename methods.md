Regional Water Quality Sampling
===============================

Overview
--------

Grab water samples were collected for analysis from canals and water
treatment plants in headspace-free, amber glass containers. Water
samples for metals analysis were collected in centrifuge tubes and
acidified with nitric acid for stability. Lake samples were obtained
from the epilimnion and hypolimnion by way of a Kemmerer sampler. All
samples were kept on ice in the field and stored at 4 degrees Celsius
until analyzed. Nutrient samples that could not be analyzed within 24
hours were frozen. Field measurements for dissolved oxygen, pH, and
temperature were made using a portable meter. Water clarity for lake
samples was measured using a Secchi Disk. Taste and odor compounds were
measured using solid phase micro extraction and injected onto a
GC-MS/MS. Total nutrients were obtained by way of persulfate digestion
and then analysis on a continuous flow colorimetric analyzer. Metals
data were obtained by ICP-MS.

Purpose
-------

The regional water quality sampling project began in 1999 with an EPA
order for various municipalities in the Phoenix metropolitan area to
address taste and odor issues that were plaguing the regional water
supply. The compounds of concern were identified as 2-methylisoborneol
(MIB) which causes as musty odor, and Geosmin which causes an earthy
taste. Both compounds are released by algae that grows in the reservoirs
and canals that compose the region’s surface water supply, especially
during summer when abundant sunshine and warm temperatures promote algal
blooms. Complaints from water utility users were so numerous that the
issue had to be addressed. Although these compounds do not cause any
health problems, they create foul odor and taste which causes users to
lose faith in their water utilities and question the reliability of the
treatment process. Both chemicals can be detected in concentrations as
low as 10 ng/L and during peak summer algal blooms this concentration is
regularly exceeded.

The project has been ongoing since 1999, providing valuable data to the
region’s water utilities about the water supply. The project data has
been used in a variety of other projects examining topics ranging from
disinfection by-product formation to invasive species infestation.
Initially managed by the Westerhoff Group at Arizona State University,
today the project is run by Dr. Peter Fox and Dr. Morteza Abbaszadegan.

What Parameters Do We Test?
---------------------------

As part of the Regional Water Quality Sampling Project the following
tests are performed:

-   UV254 Absorbance to look for natural organic matter

Preparation
-----------

### Ashing Glassware/DOC Vials/Filters

Prior to use in sample analysis, any materials used for carbon and
organics procedures must be ashed to remove any trace carbon present.
This is completed by placing the materials into a furnace and heating to
600 Celsius, which burns off any carbon present. This allows us to be
certain that any carbon detected during total organic carbon analysis or
UV 254 analysis was introduced from the environment and not some other
source of contamination. Objects that should be ashed include 40 mL
vials, DOC vials for the TOC analyzer, and Glass Filters for sample
processing. To ash your materials:

1.  Wrap the materials in aluminum foil. Make sure that everything is
    completely covered so that it will not become contaminated after
    removal from the furnace. Filters can be ashed by placing 50 or so
    in an envelope made by folding aluminum foil (they do not have to be
    individually placed).
2.  Place wrapped materials into the furnace located in the LER. Ensure
    that the door is able to close without obstruction. Close the door
    and lock into place by turning the handle
3.  Press the run button once. You should see a program pop up. Press
    the run button again. You will hear a click. The furnace will
    automatically heat to 600 Celsius and cool off. Do not open the
    furnace door if the internal temperature is more than 100 Celsius.
    This will result in glassware shattering due to rapid temperature
    change.
4.  Once materials have cooled bring them back to the lab and place them
    in a safe place.

### Autoclaving Microbial Bottles

Bottles used for microbial samples must be autoclaved prior to use in
order to sterilize them. This ensures that all microbial colonies
detected during sampling are actually coming from the sample and not
just from contamination in the bottles. The autoclave is located in
ISTB4 Lab 321. To autoclave the bottles follow this procedure:

1.  Check to make sure that what you are autoclaving is actually
    autoclavable. Using non-autoclavable bottles will result in them
    melting and possibly damaging the autoclave.
2.  Loosen caps on the bottles so that they are only tightened a quarter
    turn. If the caps are too tight the change in pressure in the
    autoclave will result in rupturing of the bottles.
3.  Place a strip of autoclave tape over the top of the bottle/cap to
    ensure that the cap does not fall off the bottle. The autoclave tape
    will turn black upon completion to help you verify that the proper
    temperature for sterilization did actually occur.
4.  Check to make sure autoclave is at proper water levels. There should
    be water inside the bottom of the autoclave and the water tank
    should have a level between low and high.
5.  Place bottles in the basket and place inside autoclave. Secure the
    lid by locking the latch.
6.  Select solid mode and ensure that temperature is set for 121 C and
    time is set for 15 minutes. Autoclaving takes approximately 1.5
    hours.
7.  Remove objects from autoclave and secure lids. Store in a place
    where no one will mistakenly steal sterilized bottles.

### Preparation of Microbial Media

We need to make two types of media – Brilliance for coliform and E. coli
detection and 7H11 for mycobacterium detection. Each plate should have
15-20 mL of media in it to avoid drying out during incubation.

#### To make Brilliance media:

1.  Figure out how much media you will be making. You can make up to 2
    months of media at a time. Each site where microbial measurements
    are taken (Pima, 56th, Cent, R3, HOC, HTC, MOC, R11, R12, R13, HWY
    87, and R25) needs its own plate.
2.  Measure out the required volume of water. You will need to use DI
    water.
3.  Pour water into a flask place on hotplate and begin heating. Add a
    magnetic stirrer and mix.
4.  Measure out the media (the side of the bottle has the required ratio
    of media to water).
5.  Add the media and cover the flask with aluminum foil.
6.  Once the solution is boiling and clears up turn off the heat.
7.  Cool the media down to 50 C (approximately when you can touch the
    glass without burning your hand).
8.  Turn on a Bunsen burner and allow it to run. Using a 25 mL
    serological pipette fill each plate with 15ish mL of liquid media.
    Allow media to cool on benchtop.
9.  Once media is cool and has solidified place the plates in a bag and
    label with your name, media type and date. Store lid side down in
    the fridge until use is required.

#### To make 7H11 media:

1.  Figure out how much media you will be making. You can make up to 2
    months of media at a time. You will need 1 plate for every 2
    sampling sites.
2.  Measure out the required volume of water. You will need to use DI
    water.
3.  Pour water into a flask place on hotplate and begin heating. Add a
    magnetic stirrer and mix.
4.  Measure out the media (the side of the bottle has the required ratio
    of media to water).
5.  Add the media and 1 mL of 50% glyceryl solution for every 100 mL of
    solution and cover the flask with aluminum foil.
6.  Once the solution is boiling and clears up turn off the heat.
7.  Take the solution along with another flask filled with 100 mL DI
    water to the autoclave and autoclave on the 15 min liquid default
    cycle.
8.  Once autoclave is complete bring the solution back to the lab and
    place it on a mixer. Add 10 mL of OADC growth supplement (kept in
    the fridge) for every 100 mL of solution. Transfer 10 mL of
    autoclaved DI water into 1 vial of Panta BBL Antibiotic (also kept
    in fridge) mix and add to solution for every 100 mL of solution. Mix
    thoroughly
9.  Turn on a Bunsen burner and allow it to run. Using a 25 mL
    serological pipette fill each plate with 15ish mL of liquid media.
    Allow media to cool on benchtop.
10. Once media is cool and has solidified place the plates in a bag and
    label with your name, media type and date. Store lid side down in
    the fridge until use is required.

Analysis
--------

### Membrane Filtration for E. coli and Fecal Coliforms

Within 24 hours of sample collection you will need to filter the
microbial samples to quantify coliforms and E. coli. Samples should be
refrigerated from collection until membrane filtration. To perform
membrane filtration:

1.  Gather required supplies for membrane filtration (forceps, Bunsen
    burner and propane, Millipore membrane filters, ethyl alcohol,
    lighter, autoclaved filtration cups).
2.  Check the level of the pump oil and fill to the line if necessary.
3.  Remove the cap from one of the vacuums on the filtration unit. Spray
    with ethyl alcohol solution and light with Bunsen burner. This will
    sterilize the surface.
4.  Flame the forceps in the Bunsen burner. Pick up a Millipore filter
    and place on the vacuum.
5.  Place a filtration cup over the vacuum. Pour the sample up to 100 mL
    line on the filtration cup.
6.  Turn on the vacuum pump and twist the valve to open the vacuum to
    filter the samples.
7.  Once all of the sample has drained through the vacuum close the
    valve and shut off the pump.
8.  Flame the forceps, remove the filtration cup, and pick up the filter
    from the vacuum. Place on top of the Brilliance media plate (hatched
    side up) being careful not to trap any air bubbles under the filter.
9.  Repeat the process until all samples have been filtered. Place all
    plates in the incubator lid side down. Incubate 18-24 hours and
    count. Coliform colonies are purple/pink while E. coli colonies are
    blue. Be sure to dump the filtered water in the flask after you
    perform membrane filtration as part of clean up. If you cannot count
    the samples right away place them in the fridge lid side down. You
    have a few days before the plates will no longer be countable.

### Membrane Filtration for Mycobacterium

Mycobacterium is the other microbe that we look for. Samples must be
filtered within 2 weeks of collection (mycobacterium is a much hardier
organism than coliforms). Samples should be refrigerated from collection
until membrane filtration. To perform membrane filtration:

1.  Gather required supplies for membrane filtration (forceps, Bunsen
    burner and propane, Millipore membrane filters, ethyl alcohol,
    lighter, autoclaved filtration cups).
2.  Check the level of the pump oil and fill to the line if necessary.
3.  Remove the cap from one of the vacuums on the filtration unit. Spray
    with ethyl alcohol solution and light with Bunsen burner. This will
    sterilize the surface.
4.  Flame the forceps in the Bunsen burner. Pick up a Millipore filter
    and place on the vacuum.
5.  Place a filtration cup over the vacuum. Pour the sample up to 100 mL
    line on the filtration cup.
6.  Turn on the vacuum pump and twist the valve to open the vacuum to
    filter the samples. Drain the sample down to approximately 5 mL and
    close the valve (shut off the pump).
7.  Add 5 mL of 4% NaOH solution. Cover the filtration cup with aluminum
    foil and let it sit for 30 minutes.
8.  After 30 minutes add 5 mL of 3% HCl solution. Allow the sample to
    sit for 1 minute to neutralize. Turn on the pump and drain the
    remaining sample. 9. Once all of the sample has drained through the
    vacuum close the valve and shut off the pump.
9.  Flame the forceps, remove the filtration cup, and pick up the filter
    from the vacuum. Place on top of the 7H11 media plate (hatched side
    up) being careful not to trap any air bubbles under the filter.
10. Repeat the process until all samples have been filtered. Place all
    plates in the incubator lid side down. Incubate for 2 weeks and
    count.

Due to the expense of the 7H11 media we generally put 2 filters on each
plate. If you cannot count the samples right away place them in the
fridge lid side down. You have a few days before the plates will no
longer be countable.

### Sample Filtration for UV254/DOC

Collected samples will need to be filtered through ashed 0.45 micron
glass filters to remove particles to ensure that the only carbon
remaining is dissolved carbon (the difference between DOC – Dissolved
Organic Carbon and TOC- Total Organic Carbon). To filter these samples
follow the following procedure:

1.  Make sure that you have ashed the 0.45 micron glass filters before
    filtration
2.  Using a gloved hand place 1 filter inside the filter tip for the 60
    mL syringe.
3.  Attach the filter tip to the 60 mL syringe once the plunger has been
    removed.
4.  Pour 20-30 mL of your sample from the 250 mL amber bottle into the
    syringe, swirl and dump out to rinse the syringe.
5.  Fill the 60 mL syringe all the way full of your sample. Place the
    syringe over the 40 mL vial, insert the plunger and flush sample
    through the filter down to the 40 mL mark on the syringe.
6.  Dump the vial out to rinse it.
7.  Filter the remaining 40 mL from the syringe into the 40 mL vial and
    cap.
8.  Move on to the next sample.

### UV254

To run UV254 follow this procedure:

1.  Turn on the Hach DR 5000 by flicking the power switch back panel on
    the upper left side.
2.  System will perform self check
3.  Select single wavelength, confirm that 254 is the wavelength
    selected
4.  Insert cuvette filled with nanopure and select zero
5.  Dump the nanopure and fill with your sample sample then press read,
    it will display the absorbance value.
6.  Record the absorbance value, dump your sample and refill the cuvette
    with the next sample.
7.  Once all samples have been run flick the power switch to turn off
    the machine.

In between samples you may spill on the cuvette. Use a kimwipe to clean
off the surface of the cuvette without scratching it. Make sure that you
are using a quartz cuvette. The plastic cuvettes will not give you
accurate results.

### DOC

Once you have filtered your samples into the 40 mL amber vials you can
run DOC (Dissolved Organic Carbon). The tool we use for this is the
Shimadzu TOC-5000A Total Organic Carbon Analyzer.

To operate the TOC-5000A complete the following procedure:

1.  Turn on the gas cylinder by turning the metal valve on top of the
    cylinder in a counterclockwise direction 1 turn. You should see the
    indicators on the regulator turn to indicate the pressure of the
    cylinder and the pressure of the gas flowing through the line. The
    right indicator is the pressure of the cylinder, which should be
    about 2000 psi when full. This pressure will slowly decrease over
    time as you run samples until it reaches 500 psi, in which case the
    cylinder pressure will be too low to continue operation and a new
    cylinder will have to be ordered. The indicator on the left is the
    pressure of the gas flowing through the line, which should be
    adjusted to 90 psi by turning the dial on the regulator.
2.  Turn on the TOC Analyzer by flipping the switch located on the
    bottom rear of the left side panel of the machine. It will begin to
    power on. Press F5 for the ASI Initial Option, which will begin to
    start up the machine. The autosampler will begin to rotate and
    toggle the needles back and forth as part of a self check. Once home
    position is found the machine will be turned on. Press F1 for next.
3.  Use the arrows on the control panel to select option 3 General
    Conditions. Press Enter to select. Scroll down to Furnace On/Off and
    press 1 to turn it to TOC mode. This will begin to heat the furnace
    of the TOC Analyzer. Return to the main menu by selecting F2.
4.  Scroll down to 6 Monitor to observe the conditions of the machine.
    There are 5 characteristics here to ensure that the machine is
    operating correctly: TC Furnace Temperature (Should be 680 C for
    proper operation), Dehumidifier Temperature (Should be 0.5-2 C for
    proper operation), Baseline Position (should be at the middle of the
    screen near 0 on the plot), Baseline Fluctuation (should be smooth
    without any waves), and Baseline Noise (should not have bumps in the
    baseline). Once everything is ready it will say OK next to each
    parameter and if things are not ready they will say NG. The Green
    light will come on next to Ready on the front panel once the machine
    is ready to run samples. You can check the carrier gas in the
    machine (next to sparge gas) and adjust to 150 ml/min for proper
    operation. Sparge gas should be adjusted to 90 ml/min when sparging.
    You generally want to run a steady baseline for a few hours prior to
    initiating a sample run.
5.  Load your samples and standards into the autosampler. Number a piece
    of paper with the numbers of the vials on the autosampler. Begin by
    loading blanks (nanopure water) into the first 3 vials. Pour your
    filtered samples from the 40 mL vials into the DOC vials and place
    them in position, noting the vial number on your piece of paper. 3
    Blanks should be run every 10-12 vials to validate accuracy of the
    TOC analysis. Blanks should be within +/- 0.5 mg/L of 0 mg/L to
    ensure accurate data.
6.  Perform a final check of the machine prior to beginning your run.
    Ensure that all of the samples and standards have been properly
    loaded. Ensure that the lid of the autosampler is properly on.
    Ensure that the nanopure rinse water and humidifier water levels are
    appropriately full. Ensure that there is enough printout paper
    loaded in the top of the machine. Address these issues before
    beginning sample run.
7.  Return to the main menu and select 9 Auto Sampler to set up your
    sample run. Under Type make sure that NPOC is selected. For IS,
    which means initial sample, type the number of the initial vial you
    would like to run from the autosampler. For FS, which means final
    sample, type the number of the final vial you would like to run from
    the autosampler. Under C1 click enter to select the calibration
    curve. Using CAL Curve F1 you will see the 1st Standard as 10 mg/L
    in vial S4, 2nd Standard as 5 mg/L in vial S3, 3rd Standard as 1
    mg/L in vial S2, and 4th Standard as 0 mg/L in vial S1. You should
    select an injection volume of 53 microliters, 3 injections with a
    maximum of 5, an SD of 200, and a CV of 2.0%. Sparge time should be
    set to 5 minutes. Make sure shift to origin and acid addition are
    both off. Press F2 to return.
8.  Ensure that your sample volume is set to 53 microliters, 3
    injections with a maximum of 5, 200 SD, 2.0% CV, and 2 SP (sparge
    time) for your samples. Once this is complete press F1 for next.
    Ensure that Rinse is turned on, 2 needle washes and 2 flow line
    washes are selected. Press F2 for next. Press Start and your samples
    will begin to run.

The autosampler will allow for your samples to run on their own without
any additional effort from you. Samples can be run overnight. It
generally takes between 18-24 hours to run an entire month’s worth of
samples. Once you return to see that all the samples have finished
running you can power down the machine if it has cooled. The machine
will tell you whether it is ok to power down or whether you should allow
it to stay on for 30 minutes to prevent overheating. To power down the
machine flick the power switch and turn off the gas cylinder.

### TDN

TDN is run by the Goldwater Environmental Lab.
